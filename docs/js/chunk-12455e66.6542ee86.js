I’m experienced in programming with java, a little bit of python, and creating blueprints in Unreal Engine. The programs I’ve made in java include a calculator that reads a string (for instance “2(3) + 4”) and outputs the answer, a visual clock with 3 hands and 12 numbers, and a bank simulator with tellers and customers. In Language Processing I translated programs from java into python; In Software Engineering I collaborated with two other students to make a horror video game in Unreal Engine. I’m very confident that I will be able to use what I will learn from this course in my future career. Web programming is something I’d like to practice because I get ideas for how to make websites better and it would be great to actually have the skills for it. I can see myself taking part in designing a website, regardless of what the website was, and just tweaking it until I feel that the layout and UI is greatly intuitive. I’m hoping I can use my degree to somehow help people with mental illness, perhaps by making an app that could help connect people with mental illness in some way.
